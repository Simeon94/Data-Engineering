Because there are many ways that we can format a date, such as `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YY`, `Xth MONTH YEAR` etc. In our dataframe above, our dates are actually formatted as just one number. Pandas provides us with a useful helper for constructing datetimes - that is, with the [`.to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html) method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we look into this, it's valuable to quickly introduce how dates are typically stored in computers. Typically, dates are calculated against the number of seconds elapsed since **1st January 1970**. When we want to, let's say, find the difference in time between 3/2/2013 16:00 and 21/1/2013 09:00, the program performs its operations on the **Epoch/Unix/POSIX time** for those values, and we can subsequently code something up to provide us the value back back in a format we want (e.g. 13 days, 7 hours). Speaking with numbers:\n",
        "- **3/2/2013 16:00** = 1,359,907,200\n",
        "- **21/1/2013 09:00** = 1,358,758,800\n",

Analysing each one individually, we see that the first row's data has most likely had the `pg_loan` value entered incorrectly (£97,000 for a postgraduate loan). In the second, for some reason the `total_loan` value has not been calculated. A naive strategy could be to overwrite the whole total loan amounts with the summation of `ug_loan` and `pg_loan`. This fixes the types of error on which the second row is returned. However there could be an underlying issue because of the first row. If we sum the `ug_loan` and `pg_loan` here, we will create an **outlier** (these will be covered in detail later). In a real dataset, it is a very real threat mistakes like these could occur which compromise the integrity of the data - issues like these can easily slip the mind so make sure you take the time to think through how your actions are going to affect your data.\n",

The rows with `total_loan = 0` probably occured due to some systematic error - perhaps from from some other database where the total_loan amount wasn't present. Other checks considering, one solution we could opt for is to sum the two columns together."
